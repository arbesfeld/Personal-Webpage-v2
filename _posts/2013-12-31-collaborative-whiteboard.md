summary:    I worked with [Matthew Tancik](http://www.matthewtancik.com) and [Anubhav Jain](https://twitter.com/_anubhavj) to create a multi-peer collaborative whiteboard. The Java application lets multiple people collaborate in a Photoshop-style drawing environment, complete with  brushes, layers, and opacity. Code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/arbesfeld/Collaborative-Whiteboard).
