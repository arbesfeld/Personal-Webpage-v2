summary:    Synced is an iOS app that lets you create an interactive shared playlist with your friends and listen as songs, movies, and YouTube videos are played perfectly in sync among all devices. Apple rejected it from the App Store, but the [source code](https://github.com/arbesfeld/Synced) is still around if you want to try it yourself.
