summary:    In Freshman Fall I took a class with visiting professor Chuck Hoberman called [Mechanical Invention Through Computation](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.S080/). I worked with [Nadya Peek](http://infosyncratic.nl/) and [James Coleman](http://parapractice.net/) to build [an expanding kite](#kite) based on a tetrahedral design by Alexander Graham Bell. We also worked on [a project](#automated-design) that lets people design expanding objects on an iPad and instantly laser cut the parts.

### <a name="automated-design"></a> Automated Expanding-Linkage Design Tool

I built an iPad app that lets users create expanding linkages like these:
