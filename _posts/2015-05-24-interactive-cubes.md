summary:    6.115 Microcontroller Lab is one of the best courses at MIT and a frequent winner of the [Big Screw award](http://tech.mit.edu/V131/N18/bigscrew.html). For my final project in the class, I created a set of interactive cubes which could attach magnetically to each other and sense their configuration. A user can rearrange cubes and change each cube's color via a JavaScript app.
